                <p>
                    I've been wanting to showcase my feelings recently because we haven't been able to talk for some obvious reasons, which I don't mind. However, during this time, I've realized the urge to talk to you more. There's something missing in my day, and I miss the feelings I used to have when I found out you wouldn't be talking anymore. It had a negative impact.  

                </p>

            <p>


                As you mentioned, I've had feelings for other girls, and it hasn't been long, so I shouldn't have become so attached to you. However, I have my reasons for feeling this way, something that I've experienced so far, which doesn't depend on the needs of either of us. But it's something different with you for the obvious reasons i stated above.
